## React Easy App
Create a React app using parcel and minimum configuration.

### Installing the CLI 
first time you need to install the react-easy CLI via this command.
```sh
npm install -g @naman360/react-easy-app
```

### Usage
Just execute
```sh
react-easy-app
```

It will create a directory called `<project-name>` entered by you while configuring the app, 
Inside that directory, it will generate the initial project structure and install the transitive dependencies:

```
<project-name>
├── node_modules
├── package.json
├── public
│   ├── index.html
└── src
    ├── style.css
    ├── index.js
```

Just open `index.js` and start writing code.<br>
Once the installation is done, you can open your project folder:

```sh
cd <project-name>
```

Inside the newly created project, you can run some built-in commands:

### `npm start`
